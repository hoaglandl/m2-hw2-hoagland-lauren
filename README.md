My only main issue was getting the spacing between the rows/cols of the images to look nice together without changing the size of the actual image. I also had difficulty removing the excess space created around the image when adding the dropshadow. Overall, I managed to work through and figure out the basics. I like how bootstrap allows you to style an image or row/col right inside the class name rather than having to create a class for CSS. It saves a developer from doing extra work.
